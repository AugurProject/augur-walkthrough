# Testing Trading:

Login to an account with ETH. For this test, you will need more than one account ready because we will want to test both sides of trading.

For these tests, you should [create a new market](/createMarket.md) and do not provide any liquidity for that market.

For these tests, we are going to assume that Account 1 is also the Market Creator.
